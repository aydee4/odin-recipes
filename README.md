This is a project I am embarking on in my quest to learn and one day become proficient in using HTML.

The aim of this project is to design a webpage with recipes.

By the end of this project I will have successfully shown that I understand how to write and use HTML at a beginner level.

## REFLECTION

I have created three recipe pages linking back to the homepage.

Two of the three pages are complete with a description, ingredients, and steps.

Initially I planned to complete all three pages however I feel that after completing two of them I feel confident enough using HTML at this level.
